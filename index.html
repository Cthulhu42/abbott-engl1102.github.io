        Fantasy and Dragons
    </h1>
    <br>
    <p>
        As a kid, I used to <em>love</em> dragons.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        They captured seemingly every moment of my early childhood. Some of the earliest books I read were about dragons, I learned songs about dragons, drew dragons in my school notebook and pretened to be a dragon on the playground. While I certainly knew that dragons were not real, I nevertheless poured over any depiction of dragons I was given.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        I wasn’t picky either. Giant dragons, tiny dragons, rideable dragons, evil dragons, dragons with 2, 4, or any other number of legs, dragons that could and cold not breathe fire, all of these were accepted as “dragons”. If it was vaguely reptilian and clearly awesome, I was fine with it being labeled a dragon.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        This uncritical acceptance of dragonhood began to shift as I got older. As I learned about taxonomy, biology, and the tree of life in our real world, I began to wonder if something similar could be applied to fantastical species too. Was a two-legged dragon really a dragon, or was it a wyvern? Were wings a necessary component of dragons? How did dragons breathe fire? Was there some universal method that could be described and examined? Could we use reality’s science to classify fantasy?

        My wonder at dragons had shifted. When once I’d been content to just go along with whatever the author of a dragon told me, I now read books on “Dragonology”, Googled “types of dragons” into the family laptop, and adopted an almost cynical view of the dragons I’d once loved so fervently. Dragons now had to fit into my definition, otherwise they were wyverns, or lindworms, or drakes, or any other of a number of "lesser" dragons.

        This dedication to classification spiraled into itself. There was always another layer, another family of dragons, another way to categorize dragons. What I failed to realize was that dragons <em>resist</em> classification. Trying to force a rigid framework onto creatures born of shifting myths and legends will <em>never</em> work. There will always be an edge case, always grey areas, and there will always be examples that don’t quite fit the mold crafted for them.

        It feels ingenuine to discuss classifying dragons in fantasy without bringing up J.R.R. Tolkien’s oft-cited thoughts on them. Tolkien claimed that “dragons, real dragons, essential both to the machinery and the ideas of a poem or story, are actually rare”<sup>[1]</sup>. Tolkien claims that dragons are characterized not by what they look like, but how they relate to the plot and themes of a story. However, even this classification has its grey areas. How do we categorize dragon-like entities that do not fit this definition? Must dragons always be a driving force for the plot, or can they just offer guidance for the characters?
